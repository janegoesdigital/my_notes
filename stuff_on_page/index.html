	<h1>Here is my page</h1>
	<h1>Adding text generated by the javascript file</h1>
	<p>The steps are:
		<ol>
			<li>Create a new paragraph</li>
			<li>Define in the HTML the id that you want the thing to go into - in this case addText</li>
			<li>Define in the HTML the id that you want the thing to go into - in this case addText</li>

	</p>
	<p id="addText"></p>


	<h1>Handling events</h1>
	<p>I want to make this button do something when clicked.  There are different ways of doing this.
		The way John Duckett recommends is to use event listeners.  You add an event listener, and then
		tell it what function to do.  This is what I've done here to change the text of the button.
		First, in the javascript, I need to select the button</p>

	<button id="counter">Change me by pressing my buttons.</button>

	<h1>Receiving and using data from forms</h1>
		<p>Need both a form and an event listener</p>
		<form id="myform" action="#" method="get">
			p>Add your user name <input type="text" id="dataField" value="" name="dataField" size="15" maxlength="30">
				<input type="submit" id="submitButton" name="submitButton" value="Submit"></p>
		</form>

		<a href="#" onclick="console.log('The link was clicked.'); return false">
  Click me
</a>
